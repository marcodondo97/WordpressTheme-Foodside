Simple and minimal theme for blog based on wordpress.

The aim of this project is to create a blog theme for wordpress.

To create this theme i downloaded starter blank theme on underscores. Link https://underscores.me/
After that i linked tha blank project with bootstrap and Jquery libreries throught function.php file.

To create the graphic mockup i used Marvel prototype. Link https://marvelapp.com/

In index page there are some section:

The section where inser the last sticky post (this section is thought for insert welcome post or presentation post);

Form to search posts (or food recipes);

The section for the recents post

The section horizontal scrollable to search the categories.


I also created two page custom:

About page: to display the writers of the blog (authors.php),

Contact page: to display contact form to send message to admin (contact.php), this page works thanks to SMTP protocol, check your hosting service enabled this service.


WARNING

To modify jumbotron background you shuld use the additional css (after log in WP click on paint logo and then click on additional CSS) and write this code:

.jumbotron{
background-image:url('');
 /* inside '' you should insert the path of your image */
}


To modify the background color of the navbar menu you should do the same thing but in addtional CSS you paste this code:

.navbar{
background-color: ;
 /* write the name or the flag color after : */
}

The default language of theme is English but there is also the translation in italian language.
